  "abstract" : "In this paper we outline a module design for a rigid body simulator. The purpose of the module design is to clarify how many parts a simulator consist of and how these parts work together. The module design can be used as a guideline for how one should implement a simulator. The paper contributes to the field of dynamics simulation by introducing the concepts of a time control module, a motion solver and a contact analysis module.",
