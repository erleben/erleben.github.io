  "abstract" : "Fast and robust signed distance field computation is often either a performance bottleneck due to high resolution fields or nearly im- possible due to degeneracies in input meshes. Thus, it can be te- dious and very time consuming to obtain a signed distance field to be used for collision detection in for instance a physical based animation, motion planing, or geometry processing. Sign leaking problems in scan conversion methods may result in erroneous signed distance fields for even perfect two-manifold meshes. We present solutions for the sign leaking problems. The major contribution is the robust handling of errors caused by over- lapping bounded volumes of neighboring features. Our method is simple to implement, and has a tradeoff between performance and quality. Further the method is robust in the sense that it handles the sign problems of previous work. The novelty lies in representing the narrow-band as a decompo- sition of tetrahedra, a shell mesh. We provide numerous examples and comparisons on different methods for generating the narrow- band shell.",
