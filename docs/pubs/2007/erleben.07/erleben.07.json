  "authors" : ["Kenny Erleben"],
  "abstract" : "Multibody dynamics are used in interactive and real-time applications, ranging from computer games to virtual prototyping, and engineering. All these areas strive towards faster and larger scale simulations. Particularly challenging are large-scale simulations with highly organized and structured stacking. We present a stable, robust, and versatile method for multibody dynamics simulation. Novel contributions include a new, explicit, fixed time-stepping scheme for velocity-based complementarity formulations using shock propagation with a simple reliable implementation strategy for an iterative complementarity problem solver specifically optimized for multibody dynamics.",
