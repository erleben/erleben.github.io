  "abstract" : "Low count tetrahedral meshes are desirable for producing shell maps or animating deformable objects, where accuracy is less important. This paper presents a new method for creating a shell tetrahedral mesh from a triangular sur- face mesh. We propose to use signed distance fields to im- plicitly represent the medial surface of a surface mesh com- bined with a divergence based medial surface representa- tion. An iterative path tracing algorithm is the main result, which is easy to parallelize. The new method respects the structure of the object shape, when generating a shell mesh. We demonstrate the capability of our method to create thick shells with almost no residual space inside our test objects.",
