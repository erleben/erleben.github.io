For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

Smoke Simulation for Fire Engineering using a Multigrid Method on Graphics Hardware

Abstract
We present a GPU–based Computational Fluid Dynamics solver for the purpose of fire engineering. We apply a multigrid method to the Jacobi solver when solving the Poisson pressure equation, supporting internal boundaries. Boundaries are handled on the coarse levels, ensuring that boundaries will never vanish after restriction. We demonstrate cases where the multigrid solver computes results up to three times more accurate than the standard Jacobi method within the same time. Providing rich visual details and flows closer to widely accepted standards in fire engineering. Making accurate interactive physical simulation for engineering purposes, has the benefit of reducing production turn-around time. We have measured speed-up improvements by a factor of up to 350, compared to existing CPU-based solvers. The present CUDA-based solver promises huge potential in economical benefits, as well as constructions of safer and more complex buildings. In this paper, the multigrid method is applied to fire engineering. However, this is not a limitation, since improvements are possible for other fields as well. Traditional Jacobi solvers are particular suitable for the methods presented.
