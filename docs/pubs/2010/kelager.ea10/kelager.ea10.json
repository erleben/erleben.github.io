  "abstract" : "Efficient simulation of contact is of interest for numerous physics-based animation applications. For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

Title
A Triangle Bending Constraint Model for Position-Based Dynamics

Authors

Abstract
We present a novel bending model and constraint creation method for position-based dynamics. Our new bending model is introduced as an alternative to the current state-of-the-art dihedral bending model. Our model is motivated by geometric principles and works on virtual triangles. It has the same cheap computational cost as the stick constraint model but with higher simulation quality and faster convergence than the dihedral bending model. With the model a new global bending parameter is introduced that makes it easier and more intuitive to control the bending deformation. Further we propose a new constraint creation method that is well suited for the triangle bending model and is less affected by the underlying mesh tessellation.
