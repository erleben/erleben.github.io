  "abstract" : "We present a novel approach to ﬂuid simulation, allowing us to take into account the surface energy in a precise manner. This new approach combines a novel, topology-adaptive approach to deformable interface tracking, called the deformable simplicial complexes method (DSC) with an optimization-based, linear ﬁnite element method for solving the incompressible Euler equations. The deformable simplicial complexes track the surface of the ﬂuid: the ﬂuid-air interface is represented explicitly as a piecewise linear surface which is a subset of tetrahedralization of the space, such that the interface can be also represented implicitly as a set of faces separating tetrahedra marked as inside from the ones marked as outside. This representation introduces insigniﬁcant and controllable numerical diffusion, allows robust topological adaptivity and provides both a volumetric ﬁnite element mesh for solving the ﬂuid dynamics equations as well as direct access to the interface geometry data, making inclusion of a new surface energy term feasible. Furthermore, using an unstructured mesh makes it straightforward to handle curved solid boundaries and gives us a possibility to explore several ﬂuid-solid interaction scenarios.",
