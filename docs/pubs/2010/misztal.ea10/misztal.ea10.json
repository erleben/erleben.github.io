  "abstract" : "Efficient simulation of contact is of interest for numerous physics-based animation applications. For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

Abstract
We present a novel approach to ﬂuid simulation, allowing us to take into account the surface energy in a precise manner. This new approach combines a novel, topology-adaptive approach to deformable interface tracking, called the deformable simplicial complexes method (DSC) with an optimization-based, linear ﬁnite element method for solving the incompressible Euler equations. The deformable simplicial complexes track the surface of the ﬂuid: the ﬂuid-air interface is represented explicitly as a piecewise linear surface which is a subset of tetrahedralization of the space, such that the interface can be also represented implicitly as a set of faces separating tetrahedra marked as inside from the ones marked as outside. This representation introduces insigniﬁcant and controllable numerical diffusion, allows robust topological adaptivity and provides both a volumetric ﬁnite element mesh for solving the ﬂuid dynamics equations as well as direct access to the interface geometry data, making inclusion of a new surface energy term feasible. Furthermore, using an unstructured mesh makes it straightforward to handle curved solid boundaries and gives us a possibility to explore several ﬂuid-solid interaction scenarios.
