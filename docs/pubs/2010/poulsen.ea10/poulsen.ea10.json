  "abstract" : "Efficient simulation of contact is of interest for numerous physics-based animation applications. For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

Title
Heuristic Convergence Rate Improvements of the Projected Gauss–Seidel Method for Frictional Contact Problems

Abstract
In interactive physical simulation, contact forces are applied to prevent rigid bodies from penetrating and control slipping between bodies. Accurate contact force determination is a computationally hard problem. Thus, in practice one trades accuracy for performance. The result is visual artifacts such as viscous or damped contact response. In this paper, we present heuristics for improving performance for solving contact force problems in interactive rigid body simulation. We formulate the contact force problem as a nonlinear complementarity problem, and discretize the problem using a splitting method and a minimum map reformulation. The resulting model is called the Projected Gauss–Seidel method. Quantitative research results are presented and can be used as a taxonomy for selecting a suitable heuristic when using the Projected Gauss–Seidel method.
