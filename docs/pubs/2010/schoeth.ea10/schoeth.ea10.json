  "abstract" : "We present a novel photon mapping algorithm for animations. We extend our previous work on photon differentials [12] with time differentials. The result is a first order model of photon cones in space an time that effectively reduces the number of required photons per frame as well as efficiently reduces temporal aliasing without any need for in-between-frame photon maps.",
