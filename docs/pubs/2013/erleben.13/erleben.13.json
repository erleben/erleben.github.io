  "abstract" : "This course provides an introduction to the definition of linear complementarity problems (LCPs) and outlines the derivation of a toolbox of numerical methods. It also presents a small convergence study on the methods to illustrate their numerical properties. The course is a good introduction to implementing numerical methods, because it includes tips and tricks for implementation based on considerable practical experience.",
