  "abstract" : "Efficient simulation of contact is of interest for numerous physics-based animation applications. For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

Abstract
Continuous and prolonged use of the speaking voice may lead to functional speech disorders that are not apparent for voice clinicians from high-speed imaging of the vocal folds’ vibration. However, it is hypothesized that time dependent tissue properties provide some insight into the injury process. To infer material parameters via an inverse optimization problem from recorded deformation, a self sustained theoretical model of the vocal folds is needed. With this purpose, a transversely isotropic three-dimensional nite element model is proposed and investigated. Special attention is paid to the collision and time integration schemes. Accuracy in the deformation process is introduced by means of a topology-adaptive method for deformable interface tracking, called the Deformable Simplicial Complex, which has been previously applied to immiscible uids. For computational reasons, aerodynamic driving forces are derived from Bernoulli’s principle.
