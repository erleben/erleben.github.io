  "abstract" : "Efficient simulation of contact is of interest for numerous physics-based animation applications. For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

Title
Numerical Methods for Linear Complementarity Problems in Physics-Based Animation

Abstract
Linear complementarity problems (LCPs) have for many years been used in physics-based animation to model contact forces between rigid bodies in contact. More recently, LCPs have found their way into the realm of fluid dynamics. Here, LCPs are used to model boundary conditions with fluid-wall contacts. LCPs have also started to appear in deformable models and granular simulations. There is an increasing need for numerical methods to solve the resulting LCPs with all these new applications. This book provides a numerical foundation for such methods, especially suited for use in computer graphics. This book is mainly intended for a researcher/Ph.D. student/post-doc/professor who wants to study the algorithms and do more work/research in this area. Programmers might have to invest some time brushing up on math skills, for this we refer to Appendices A and B. The reader should be familiar with linear algebra and differential calculus. We provide pseudo code for all the numerical methods, which should be comprehensible by any computer scientist with rudimentary programming skills. The reader can find an online supplementary code repository, containing Matlab implementations of many of the core methods covered in these notes, as well as a few Python implementations [Erleben, 2011].
