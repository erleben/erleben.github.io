This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators.

Title
Chunked Bounding Volume Hierarchies for Fast Digital Prototyping Using Volumetric Meshes

Abstract
We present a novel approach to using Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVHs) for collision detection of volumetric meshes for digital prototyping based on accurate simulation. In general, volumetric meshes contain more primitives than surface meshes, which in turn means larger BVHs. To manage these larger BVHs, we propose an algorithm for splitting meshes into smaller chunks with a limited-size BVH each. Limited-height BVHs make guided, all-pairs testing of two chunked meshes well-suited for GPU implementation. This is because the dynamically generated work during BVH traversal becomes bounded. Chunking is simple to implement compared to dynamic load balancing methods and can result in an overall two orders of magnitude speedup on GPUs. This indicates that dynamic load balancing may not be a well suited scheme for the GPU. The overall application timings showed that data transfers were not the bottleneck. Instead, the conversion to and from OpenCL friendly data structures was causing serious performance impediments. Still, a simple OpenMP acceleration of the conversion allowed the GPU solution to beat the CPU solution by 20 percent. We demonstrate our results using rigid and deformable body scenes of varying complexities on a variety of GPUs.
