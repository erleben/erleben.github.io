  "abstract" : "Efficient simulation of contact is of interest for numerous physics-based animation applications. For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

Abstract
Automated acquisition of friction data is an interesting approach to more successfully bridge the reality gap in simulation than conventional mathematical models. To advance this area of research, we present a novel inexpensive computer vision platform as a solution for collecting and processing friction data, and we make available the open source software and data sets collected with our vision robotic approach. This paper is focused on gathering data on anisotropic static friction behavior as this is ideal for inexpensive vision approach we propose. The data set and experimental setup provide a solid foundation for a wider robotics simulation community to conduct their own experiments.
