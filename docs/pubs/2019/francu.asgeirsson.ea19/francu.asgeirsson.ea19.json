For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

High fidelity simulation of corotational linear FEM for incompressible materials

Abstract
We present a novel method of simulating incompressible materials
undergoing large deformation without locking artifacts. We apply it
for simulating silicone soft robots with a Poisson ratio close to
0.5. The new approach is based on the mixed finite element method
(FEM) using a pressure-displacement formulation; the deviatoric
deformation is still handled in a traditional fashion. We support
large deformations without volume increase using the corotational
formulation of linear elasticity. Stability is ensured by an implicit
integration scheme which always reduces to a sparse linear system. For
even more deformation accuracy we support higher order simulation
through the use of Bernstein-Bézier polynomials.
