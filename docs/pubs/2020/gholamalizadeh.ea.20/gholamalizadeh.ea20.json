  "abstract" : "Efficient simulation of contact is of interest for numerous physics-based animation applications. For instance, virtual reality training, video games, rapid digital prototyping, and robotics simulation are all examples of applications that involve contact modeling and simulation. However, despite its extensive use in modern computer graphics, contact simulation remains one of the most challenging problems in physics-based animation. This course covers fundamental topics on the nature of contact modeling and simulation for computer graphics. Specifically, we provide mathematical details about formulating contact as a complementarity problem in rigid body and soft body animations. We briefly cover several approaches for contact generation using discrete collision detection. Then, we present a range of numerical techniques for solving the associated LCPs and NCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are further discussed in a practical manner, and best practices for implementation are discussed. Finally, we conclude the course with several advanced topics, such as anisotropic friction modeling and proximal operators. Programming examples are provided on the course website to accompany the course notes.",

Abstract

Previous studies on computational modeling of tooth move- ment in orthodontic treatments are limited to a single model and fail in generalizing the simulation results to other patients. To this end, we consider multiple patients and focus on tooth movement variations under the identical load and boundary conditions both for intra- and inter- patient analyses. We introduce a novel computational analysis tool based on finite element models (FEMs) addressing how to assess initial tooth displacement in the mandibular dentition across different patients for uncontrolled tipping scenarios with different load magnitudes applied to the mandibular dentition. This is done by modeling the movement of each patient’s tooth as a nonlinear function of both load and tooth size. As the size of tooth can affect the resulting tooth displacement, a combination of two clinical biomarkers obtained from the tooth anatomy, i.e., crown height and root volume, is considered to make the proposed model generalizable to different patients and teeth.
