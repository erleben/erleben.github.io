  "abstract" : "We present a method to generate subject-specific cartilage for the hip joint. Given bone geometry, our approach is agnostic to im- age modality, creates conforming interfaces, and is well suited for finite element analysis. We demonstrate our method on ten hip joints show- ing anatomical shape consistency and well-behaved stress patterns. Our method is fast and may assist in large-scale biomechanical population studies of the hip joint when manual segmentation or training data is not feasible.",
