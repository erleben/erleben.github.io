  "abstract" : "Topological changes like sliding motion, sources and sinks are a significant challenge in image registration. This work proposes the use of the alternating direction method of multi- pliers as a general framework for constraining the registration of separate objects with indi- vidual deformation fields from overlapping in image registration. This constraint is enforced by introducing a collision detection algorithm from the field of computer graphics which results in a robust divide and conquer optimization strategy using Free-Form Deformations. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework performs superior with regards to the combination of intersection prevention and image registration including syn- thetic examples containing complex displacement patterns. The results show compliance with the non-intersection constraints while simultaneously preventing a decrease in registra- tion accuracy. Furthermore, the application of the proposed algorithm to the DIR-Lab data set demonstrates that the framework generalizes to real data by validating it on a lung regis- tration problem.",
